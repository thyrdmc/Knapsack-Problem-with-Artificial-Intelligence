# Knapsack Problem with Artificial Intelligence
The purpose of this repository is to learn you how to apply local search algorithms while solving a problem and how to evaluate the performance of these algorithms.

# This famous problem is usually stated as follows: Given a set of items, each with a eight and a value, determine which items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
